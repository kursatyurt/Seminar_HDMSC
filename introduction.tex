\section{Introduction}

Ever increasing internet speed increased the data produced all around the world, that leads to boom in Machine Learning and Data Analytics fields.
Which are generally have many dimensional large data sets. As like all high dimensional problems, they are suffer from curse of dimensionality, i.e.\ they have an
exponential dependency on dimension. This is a barrier in numerical treatment of the high-dimensonal problems.
This exponential dependency makes harder to use classical mesh based approaches to solve this kind of problems. One could also use mesh-free methods like Monte-Carlo quadratures.

In order to overcome such a problem, the sparse grid method gains more and more popularity.
The sparse grid method is a general numerical discretization technique which is first introduced by  the Russian mathematician Smolyak in 1963~\cite{smolyak1963quadrature}.

Sparse grids offers a new way to reduce the required number of grid points by the order of magnitude \(O(2^{nd})\) to just only \(O(2^n n^{d-1})\) while preseving a similar error as using the full grid~\cite{Garcke2012}.
A comparision of storage requirement and error is listed in \cref{tab:comparisionfull}.
In order to achieve these bounds, the mixed second derivatives have to be bounded.

The sparse grid uses a hierarchical formulation as shown in \cref{fig:basiscomp} for one dimensional case.
It has an incremental and adaptive behaviour inherently. In order to extend to a general d-dimensional setting it expolits
tensor prodoct approach.

For the problems which are do not satisfy smoothness criteria or required further reduce in mesh size, one can use advantage of adaptivity.
The hierarchical basis is a direct indicator of areas where further refinement required.

In this work we will use standard hat function given by \cref{eqn:basis}.

\begin{equation}
    \phi(x ) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
        1-|x| & \text{if } x \in [-1,1] , \\
        0     & \text{otherwise}          \\
    \end{array}
    \right.
    \label{eqn:basis}
\end{equation}

On a equidistant grid \(\Omega_l \) of level \( l\) on a unit interval \(\bar{\Omega} = [0,1]\). The mesh width is given by \(2^{-l} \). The grid points on a certain level is given bibliography

\begin{equation}
    x_{l,i} = i \cdot h_l, 0 \leq i \leq 2^l
\end{equation}

Using \cref{eqn:basis} a family of basis functions \(\phi_{l,i}(x)\) with a support of \([x_{l,i}-h_l,x_{l,i}+h_l]\), by dilation and translation one could get \cref{eqn:levelbasis}. This process gives all possible basis function in level \(l\) as shown in \cref{fig:nodalbasis}.

\begin{equation}
    \phi_{l,i}(x) = \phi \left(\frac{x-i\cdot h_l}{h_l}\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    V_l = \text{span} \left\{ \phi_{l,i} : 1 \leq i \leq 2^l-1 \right\}
    \label{eqn:levelbasis}
\end{equation}

One need hierarchical ones in order to construct the sparse grid. The hierarchical increment spaces are given by \cref{eqn:hierarchicalincrementspace}.

\begin{equation}
    W_l = \text{span} \left\{ \phi_{l,i} : i \in I_l\right\}
    \label{eqn:hierarchicalincrementspace}
\end{equation}

where the index set is,

\begin{equation}
    I_l = \left\{ i \in \mathbb{N}: 1 \leq i \leq 2^l-1 , i \text{ odd} \right\}
\end{equation}

Using the resulting basis functions as input to the tensor product construction, one can obtain suitable piecewise d-linear basis function at each grid point \(x_{l,i}\)

\begin{equation}
    \phi_{l,i}(x) = \prod_{j=1}^d \phi_{l_j,i_j}(x_j)
\end{equation}
