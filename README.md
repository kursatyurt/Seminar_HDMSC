## Adaptive Sparse Grids
 
In recent years, increasing computational power and usage of high-speed internet
connections have led to an explosion in the amount of data produced. Generally,
this kind of data is used in Machine Learning problems or Data Analytics.
This data has a high dimension and is hard to process with classical grid-based approaches.
However, some techniques can be used to process this data. This paper presents an adaptive sparse
grid approach to handle this data type, where the classical sparse grid approach is insufficient.
A spatially adaptive sparse grid approach is presented.
